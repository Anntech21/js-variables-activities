/************************ Exercise 2 - Declaring Variables ************************/

// Declare three variables named firstName, lastName, and age. Assign your own values to each variable. 
let firstName = "Anchal";
let lastName = "Jain";
let age = "39";



// Log the variables' values to the console.
console.log ("firstName");
console.log ("lastName");
console.log ("age");





/************************ Exercise 3 - Swapping Variables  ************************/

// Create two variables, a and b, and assign them any values.

let a = "colin";
let b = "catie";

// Swap the values of a and b. You may use a third variable to hold a value so you don't overwrite it. Use reassignmentâ€”don't change the previous lines of code!
a = b;
let c = a;
b = c;


// Log the values of a and b before and after the swap.
//log before
console.log ("a");//colin
console.log ("b");//catie
//log after
console.log('Lets Swap! ' + a + ', use to be colin and catie is now ' + b +'.' )//catie use to be colin and catie is now colin



/************************ Exercise 4 - Working with Constants ************************/
.
// Declare a constant variable named PI and set its value to 3.14159. 
const PI = 3.14159

// Then, attempt to reassign a new value to PI. 
PI = 5245

// Observe the error in the console and write a comment here explaining why you can't reassign a constant.
constant is permantant and can not change value
